    <h3>Artist Inspired Styles <span id="searchinfo"></span></h3>
    <p>A collection of what Stable Diffusion imagines these artists' styles look like.</p>
    <p>While having an overview is helpful, keep in mind that these styles only imitate certain aspects of the artist's work (color, medium, location, etc.). They are limited by the rather superficial knowledge of SD, but can probably give you a good base for your own creations.</p>

        <h3>Camera Shot Size</h3>
        <h4>What is a camera shot?</h4>
        <p>A camera shot is composed of the series of frames that are shot uninterrupted from the moment the camera
            starts
            rolling until it stops. Camera shots are an essential aspect of filmmaking and video productions, because by
            combining different types of shots, angles and camera movements, the filmmakers are able to emphasize
            specific
            emotions, ideas and movement for each scene.</p>
        <h4>Extreme Long Shot (ELS) or Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)</h4>
        <p>An extreme long shot (or extreme wide shot) make your subject appear small against their location. You can
            use an
            extreme long shot to make your subject feel distant or unfamiliar.</p>
        <p>Take a look at this extreme wide shot from the action movie Mad Max: Fury Road:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/EWS.webp">
        <p>It can also make your subject feel overwhelmed by its location. Of all the various camera shots out there,
            consider using the extreme long shot when you need to emphasize the location or isolation.</p>
        <h4>Long Shot (LS) or Wide Shot (WS)</h4>
        <p>The long shot (also known as a wide shot, abbreviated “WS”) is the same idea, but a bit closer. If your
            subject
            is a person then his or her whole body will be in view — but not filling the shot. Here's an example of the
            wide
            shot size from the movie The Martian:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/WS.webp">
        <p>In other words, there should be a good deal of space above and below your subject. Use a long shot (or wide
            shot)
            to keep your subject in plain view amidst grander surroundings. The wide shot also lets us see the beautiful
            background imagery, as well as the onlookers which will make any big moment more cinematic. Of the many
            camera
            shots, a long shot gives us a better idea of the scene setting, and gives us a better idea of how the
            character
            fits into the area.</p>
        <h4>Full Shot (FS)</h4>
        <p>Now let's talk about camera shots that let your subject fill the frame while keeping emphasis on scenery.</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/FS_1.webp">
        <p>This full shot from one of the best Quentin Tarantino movies Django Unchained is also a tracking shot —
            meaning
            there is camera movement featured throughout the shot. In this particular case, the camera slowly moves (or
            tracks) towards Django. So, technically, this shot begins in a wide shot, moves to full shot (seen above),
            and
            eventually ends in a cowboy shot. Of all the different types of camera shots in film, full shots can be used
            to
            feature multiple characters in a single shot, like this full shot size example from Marvel's Guardians of
            the
            Galaxy:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/FS_2.webp">
        <h4>Medium Wide Shot (MWS)</h4>
        <p>A medium long shot (aka medium long shot) frames the subject from roughly the knees up. It splits the
            difference
            between a full shot and a medium shot. Here's an example of the medium wide shot size from the movie The
            Usual Suspects:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/MWS.webp">
        <p>You can always frame camera shots from any angle as well, so don't be afraid to think about medium long shots
            when behind a character.</p>
        <h4>Cowboy Shot (CS)</h4>
        <p>A variation on this is the Cowboy Shot, which frames the subject from roughly mid-thighs up. It’s called a
            “cowboy shot” because it is used in Westerns to frame a gunslinger’s gun or holster on his hip. Here's an
            example of the cowboy shot size from the movie Wonder Woman:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/CS_1.webp">
        <p>Here is an example of a cowboy shot that's used in a film that has nothing to do with cowboys, and it's also
            a three shot:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/CS_2.webp">
        <h4>Medium Shot (MS)</h4>
        <p>Let's move onto camera shots that reveal your subject in more detail. The medium shot is one of the most
            common
            camera shots. It's similar to the cowboy shot above, but frames from roughly the waist up and through the
            torso.
            So it emphasizes more of your subject while keeping their surroundings visible. Here's an example of the
            medium
            shot size from the superhero movie X-Men: Days of the Future Past:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/MS.webp">
        <p>Medium shots may seem like the most standard camera shot around, but every shot size you choose will have an
            effect on the viewer. A medium shot can often be used as a buffer shot for dialogue scenes that have an
            important moment later that will be shown in a close-up shot. If you don't use all of the different types of
            camera shots in film, how can you signal anything to your viewer without shot size contrast.</p>
        <h4>Medium Close Up Shot (MCU)</h4>
        <p>The medium close-up frames your subject from roughly the chest up. So it typically favors the face, but still
            keeps the subject somewhat distant. Here's an example of the medium close-up shot size from one of the Coen
            Brothers’ masterpieces No Country for Old Men:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/MCU.webp">
        <p>The medium close-up camera shot size keeps the characters eerily distant even during their face-to-face
            conversation.</p>
        <h4>Close Up (CU)</h4>
        <p>You know it’s time for a close-up shot when you want to reveal a subject’s emotions and reactions. The
            close-up
            camera shot fills your frame with a part of your subject. If your subject is a person, it is often their
            face.
            Here's an example of the close-up shot size:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/CU.webp">
        <p>You know it’s time for a close-up shot when you want to reveal a subject’s emotions and reactions. The
            close-up
            camera shot fills your frame with a part of your subject. If your subject is a person, it is often their
            face.
            Here's an example of the close-up shot size:</p>
        <h4>Extreme Close Up (ECU)</h4>
        <p>An extreme close-up is the most you can fill a frame with your subject. It often shows eyes, mouth and gun
            triggers. In extreme close-up shots, smaller objects get great detail and are the focal point. Use an ECU to
            emphasize a specific feature of your subject:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_size/ECU.webp">
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>How you choose to frame your subject will have a specific impact. How close or far your subject is to your
            camera
            — your shot size — will underscore how the audience should feel about it (or them). Your subject will appear
            smallest in a long shot (or wide shot). They will be larger in a medium shot and largest in a close-up shot.
        </p>

        <h3>Camera Framing</h3>
        <h4>What is camera shot framing?</h4>
        <p>Camera shot framing is the art and science of placing subjects in your shots. Camera shots are all about
            composition. Rather than pointing the camera at the subject, you need to compose an image.</p>
        <h4>Single Shot</h4>
        <p>When your shot captures one subject it’s known as a single shot:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/framing/Single_Shot.webp">
        <p>Single shots can be set and framed in any shot size you like, just as long as there is only one character
            featured within the frame.</p>
        <h4>Two Shot</h4>
        <p>A two-shot is a camera shot with two characters featured in the frame:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/framing/Two_Shot.webp">
        <p>Two shots are often really useful for allowing performances to play out in a single take, which can be
            especially
            useful for comedy.</p>
        <h4>Three Shot</h4>
        <p>A three-shot features three characters in the frame:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/framing/Three_Shot.webp">
        <p>Three shots are really important in adventure films, or really any film that has a group of characters,
            because
            it is an enormous time drain to shoot 3 singles just to show every character, not to mention jarring.</p>
        <h4>Over-The-Shoulder Shot (OTS)</h4>
        <p>Another element of camera shots to consider is the perspective of the shot. An over-the-shoulder shot shows
            your
            subject from behind the shoulder of another character. Because it emulates perspective, it’s common in
            conversation scenes.</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/framing/OTS.webp">
        <p>Over-the-shoulder shots can help to provide orientation, and connect the characters on an emotional level.
            Here's
            our breakdown of the Westworld scene and how OTS shots work so effortlessly.</p>
        <h4>Over-The-Hip Shot (OTH)</h4>
        <p>An over-the-hip shot is similar to over-the-shoulder in that the camera is placed with a character's hip in
            the
            foreground, and the focus subject in the plane of acceptable focus. Here's an example of an over-the-hip
            shot
            from the movie Minority Report:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/framing/OTH.webp">
        <p>You'll gain a similar effect from an over-the-hip shot as you would an OTS, but if you have one character
            standing, and the other sitting, kneeling, or any other configuration that places the subjects on "uneven
            terrain" it will often suggest a power imbalance. This is the benefit of blocking and staging your actors
            and
            camera.</p>
        <h4>Point of View Shot (POV)</h4>
        <p>Now let's talk about choosing camera shots that show the point-of-view (or POV) of one of your characters. A
            POV
            shot is a camera shot that shows the viewer exactly what that character sees. This transports the audience
            into
            that character.</p>

        <h3>Camera Focus</h3>
        <h4>What is depth of field?</h4>
        <p>Depth of field (DOF) is the term used to describe the size of the area in your image where objects appear
            acceptably sharp. The area in question is known as the field, and the size (in z-space) of that area is the
            depth of that field.</p>
        <p>The center most point of the field is known as the point of focus. The imaginary two dimensional plane that
            extends from that point is known as the plane of focus. And any part of your image that falls directly on
            this
            plane is officially in focus.</p>
        <h4>Rack Focus vs. Focus Pull</h4>
        <p>Manipulating focus is another way of communicating with your camera shots. The vast majority of films you
            watch
            will keep their subjects in focus 95% of the time, with the odd slip up here and there.</p>
        <p>The first assistant cameraman (or “First AC”) will pull focus to make sure that the subject stays within the
            acceptable focus range while they move to various depths within the frame.</p>
        <p>A rack focus is an emphasized focus pull, where the acceptable focus range is intentionally shifted from one
            subject to another. This is an aggressive use of focus as a story telling device:</p>
        <p>Focus Pull = Passive vs. Rack Focus = Aggressive</p>
        <h4>Shallow Focus Shot (Shallow DOF)</h4>
        <p>In shallow focus shots, your subject is in crisp focus while the foreground and background scenery is out of
            focus. This limits your depth of field to create emphasis on your subject.</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_focus/Shallow_DOF.webp">
        <h4>Deep Focus Shot</h4>
        <p>In a deep focus shot, everything in your frame is in focus. This is when you need your audience to feel the
            scenery or particular scene elements.</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_focus/Deep_Focus_Shot.webp">
        <h4>Tilt-Shift Shot</h4>
        <p>A tilt-shift lens rotates perspective within the lens and emulates selective focus. It can make parts of your
            image appear in sharp focus while others are out of focus.</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_focus/Tilt_Shift_Shot_1.webp">
        <p>Here's another tilt-shift shot example from The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/shot_focus/Tilt_Shift_Shot_2.webp">
        <h4>Soft focus</h4>
        <p>Whereas deep focus keeps everything in focus, and shallow focus keeps something in focus, soft focus shots
            keep
            nothing in 100% sharp focus. This is caused by either a flaw in the lens itself or through special filters.
        </p>
        <p>Soft focus is perfect when filming a dream or memory — the glow around everything is both wistful and
            slightly
            unreal.</p>

        <h3>Camera Angles</h3>
        <h4>What is camera shot angle?</h4>
        <p>The camera shot angle is used to specify the location where the camera is placed to take a shot. The position
            of
            the camera in relation to the subjects can affect the way the viewer perceives the scene. A scene may be
            shot
            simultaneously from multiple camera angles to amplify the cinematic effect and the emotions.</p>
        <h4>Eye Level Shot</h4>
        <p>First, consider the most common height: the eye level shot. When your subject is at eye-level they’re in a
            neutral perspective (not superior or inferior). This mimics how we see people in real life -- our eye line
            connecting with theirs.</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/angles/Eye_Level_Shot.webp">
        <h4>Low Angle Shot</h4>
        <p>A low angle shot frames the subject from a low camera height looking up at them. These camera shots most
            often
            emphasize power dynamics between characters.</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/angles/Low_Angle_Shot.webp">
        <h4>High Angle Shot</h4>
        <p>In a high angle shot, the camera points down at your subject. It usually creates a feeling of inferiority, or
            “looking down” on your subject. Here's an example of a high angle shot from the movie
            The
            Princess Bride:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/angles/High_Angle_Shot.webp">
        <h4>Hip Level Shot</h4>
        <p>A hip level shot is when your camera is roughly waist-high.</p>

        <h4>Knee Level Shot</h4>
        <p>This is when your camera height is about as low as your subject’s knees. They can emphasize a character’s
            superiority, if paired with a low angle.</p>

        <p>Here's another knee level shot example:</p>

        <h4>Ground Level Shot</h4>
        <p>A ground level shot is when your camera’s height is on ground level with your subject. Needless to say, this
            shot
            captures what’s going on the ground your subject stands on.</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/angles/Ground_Level_Shot_1.webp">
        <p>Here's another ground level shot example from one of many Stanley Kubrick's marvelous movies, Full Metal
            Jacket:

        <h4>Shoulder Level Shot</h4>
        <p>This is when your camera is roughly as high as your subject’s shoulders. Shoulder level shots are actually
            much
            more standard than an eye level shot, which can make your actor seem shorter than reality:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/angles/Shoulder_Level_Shot.webp">
        <h4>Dutch Angle or Dutch Tilt Shot</h4>
        <p>For a dutch angle (dutch tilt), the camera is slanted to one side. With the horizon lines tilted in this way,
            you
            can create a sense of disorientation. This video breaks down a key moment in Mission: Impossible when Ethan
            first realizes that he's being set up.</p>
        <h4>Bird's Eye View Shot or Overhead Shot</h4>
        <p>An overhead shot is from way up high, looking down on your subject and a good amount of the scenery
            surrounding
            him or her. This can create a great sense of scale and movement.</p>
        <p>Here's an overhead shot example:</p>
        <img width="1600" src="img/camera/angles/Overhead_Shot.webp">
        <h4>Aerial Shot</h4>
        <p>Whether taken from a helicopter or drone, this is a shot from way up high. It establishes a large expanse of
            scenery. The opening shots of the movie Blade Runner use them to establish futuristic
            cityscapes.</p>
